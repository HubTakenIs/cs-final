# Literature Review document

I will store details of how I searched for papers for my literature review. This will include my seach terms, proccess of choosing papers for the review and all of the links for refferences. All papers were accessed on the 1st of July

## Search Terms 
I will be using two different search engines for finding literature. I will use the university library search and Google Scholar. 

### University Library 
I have used terms `digital note taking` to search for papers in the university search engine.
using this search query searched for papers that contained all three terms, the first 100 results contained fairly accurate search results.
I read titles and saved papers that seemed relevant. Here is a list of all papers that I found.

### Tools

I need to do some research for the tools I will be using to build the artefact.

#### Programming language
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html#email-examples
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html

Python will be used to create the web application because of it's extensive documentation, resources and simplicity. It can also be used to interact with a database and SMTP server.
#### Frameworks
- https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/
- https://htmx.org/

Flask is a WSGI web application framework, it makes it easy to implement common web patterns. It doesn't have an ORM and has great documentation.
HTMX is a javascript library that improves standard html5 so it's possible to build modern user interfaces without the use of React.

#### Database
- https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html

Sqlite3 will be the database engine because there are packages in python and flask to interact with it. There is plenty of documentation and examples of how to interact with it. It also supports a search feature that I can use to implement a search bar.
#### Source Control
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
- https://docs.github.com/en

Git is practically industry standard source management because of the price (it's free) and it's ecosystem (GitHub and GitLab). It integrateds with GitHub very well to offer secure code backups. 
#### SMTP server
- https://mailinabox.email/
- https://mailinabox.email/guide.html#video

Mail-in-a-box seems to be the simplest SMTP server that I could find for self hosting.

## Literature Review
I will be writting the literature review and add temporary citations. Later I will add this content to the final report

### Note Taking 
Technological advancements made in recent decades have improved access to information and technology which has also advanced note taking. The digitization of note taking in recent years has sparked research in the effectiveness of digital note taking with one paper suggesting that digital notes taken on a laptop (1) are more effective than long-hand notes for similar-text related learning and image-related learning whereas long-hand notes are more effective for text-related learning however, the paper concludes that the effectiveness of either note-taking method largely depends on the contents as well as whether the notes are reviewed suggesting that spaced repetition should be used. A separate thesis claims that note-taking effectiveness also depends on whether the notes are self-generated or guided notes (2) suggesting that while guided notes alleviate the cognitive load on individuals, they could be less effective than self-generated notes because the individual would not be able to express as much freedom in their note-taking, potentially limiting their ability to create personal and meaningful notes developing relations between notes and learning material. Interestingly, the thesis claims that neither note-taking method outperformed their control condition on a multiple-choice quiz suggesting that there are many variables that need to be evaluated when considering the effectiveness of notes which are the quantity, quality, mode of note taking and review of notes (2). These studies imply that a balance of high quality and quantity of notes is required in either mode of note taking whether digital or long-hand for improved results. 

The thesis (2) also discusses student preferences between guided notes and long-hand written notes where it claims that students generally prefer guided notes and since they found that neither mode of note-taking is more effective than the other but the effectiveness solely depends on the quality, quantity and repetitive review of notes,  you could assume that there is no reason to create notes yourself however, a report on strategic note taking for students (3) disagrees and claims that strategic note-taking (self-generated note-taking) is an important skill involving the processing of information and writing and listening skills, suggesting that students with better note-taking skills achieve better grades. It argues that students who copy information for notes instead of actively processing it themselves are negatively affecting their studies because they do not fully understand the material therefore the notes are not beneficial to them. The report suggests that students should aim to improve their note quality by actively processing the learning material as it is the most beneficial while recognizing that some students find it difficult to recognize and organize content based on relevance, with that in mind it discusses an experiment involving middle school students (3) who use strategic note-taking and based on the results draws a conclusion that active self-generated notes are generally higher in quality therefore lead to improved understanding of the material which in turn leads to better grades. The report discussed thoroughly and reasonably explained why active notetaking is vital to students. However, it does not discuss how to improve note-taking skills or how often notes should be revised. 
The reviewed literature about note-taking provides insights about how valuable they can be when an individual actively processes information and creates notes of the information and periodically reviews the notes. However, based on the data of a survey conducted in 2019 (4), approximately half of students in university do not take notes as the lecture and lab study materials are available to the students online removing the need for students to attend live lectures or labs. As technology further advances and more study materials are digitized students do not feel the need or the pressure to take notes on material they can view anytime they need or use advanced tools to generate notes on the material, but these approaches do not help learn and understand the material, they simply rephrase the material (3). For my project, users would have a list of suggestions that they could incorporate to improve the quality of their notes, but it is important to consider the difference between guidelines and suggestions as the purpose of the application is to allow users to generate their own notes.

### Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition has become a highly researched subject due to the powerful effects it can have on learning when combined with high quality and quantity notes. Various studies about spaced repetition discuss the effectiveness of spaced repetition as well implications of using this study technique. Article by Sean H. K. Kang (5) discusses the spacing and interleaving of study material where he explains that interleaving items in various ways can achieve different results, for example, arranging study materials in categories “ABCABCABC” (5) would benefit motor skill acquisition and mathematics and problem solving whereas by blocking these items together you could aim to improve recognition and identification, the article Harnessing the power of spaced repetition learning and active recall (6) supports some of Sean H. K. Kang’s study claiming that spaced repetition is significantly more effective than standalone note-taking however it also discusses that active recall is overwhelmingly more effective than passive review of notes when combined with spaced repetition but I believe the article does not provide sufficient evidence to make such claims. The article (5) highlights the importance of interleaving as well as spaced repetitions, and the appropriate time frame for each spaced repetition is discussed and noted as one to eight days in between each repetition to assimilate the self-generated notes, unfortunately this article does not cover the number of repetitions to be performed which I believe to be a great oversight as. An article by Keiko Hanzawa and Yuichi Suzuki (7) briefly discusses that in their study 50% of students reported that six repetitions were beneficial while the rest reported that three to four repetitions were beneficial for them. Another study (8) also suggests that the schedule of spaced repetition is vital to the effectiveness showing that an optimal time frame in between each repetition can be calculated and should be enforced for memorization improvements however, the article only explores guided learning material and not self-generated learning material for which an optimal space for each repetition would be significantly harder to calculate. From the discussed literature a conclusion can be drawn that a minimum of three repetitions is required to perceive some effect from spaced repetitions. On top of this, a maximum of six spaced repetitions should be enforced to reduce the tedium of repetitions while also maintaining the engagement of students.

My proposed project will be using spaced repetition by notifying the user when they should revisit their notes. The goal of this project would be to make effective use of spaced repetition to improve how easily and quickly information is assimilated over time. There are countless applications that use spaced repetition however, the repetition is based off guided or pre-generated material which aims to remove the need for note-taking. The article about effectiveness of digital note-taking (9) discusses the importance of engaging with the learning material and it being cognitively challenging by forcing the individual to process it themselves rather than the learning material already being processed, I have come to the conclusion that other applications fail at being cognitively challenging which in turn makes the spaced repetition less effective, this is where my project could improve upon by giving individuals the freedom to be cognitively challenged by the material they are studying based off which they can create high quality notes, which can later be reviewed periodically.


### Effectiveness of Note-taking and Revision Help Applications

Study and Notetaking applications and tools have become more prevalent in recent years claiming to be extremely effective and promising easily achievable improvements in learning and memory. A Japanese study evaluating a note-taking applications effectiveness (10) found that 45.3% of the 3833 study participants used the note-taking application and achieved variable 25% higher scores in their medical training examination than non-app using participants depending on the individuals age, workload and whether they used online resources on top of the note-taking application. However, the study does not incorporate or review the effects spaced repetition could have on the results, I believe that using a note-taking application and incorporating variable spaced repetition the students would be able to assimilate more information therefore be able to achieve better results. A similar article evaluating another digital note-taking application (11) suggests that individuals who can consistently use the note-taking application to create high quality notes, achieve better results in tests. The article explores the idea that students need to be able to self-regulate well to achieve good results however, it concludes that it is not the case, and students do not have to be good self-regulators to achieve higher results. This finding supports my proposed project because by arguing that the individual using the note-taking application can achieve similar results whether they can or can’t self-regulate as much as other people, if they have some level of motivation to learn and improve they will.

However, a study on the impact of digital distraction on lecture taking notes and student learning (12) states that digital distractions reduce quality and quantity of taken notes which relates to self-regulation as a person who can self-regulate better would be less affected by distractions, therefore be able to produce higher quality notes. This is vital to consider for my project, the whole web application hinges on the individual using it, being able to self-regulate and actively process information to produce high quality notes which they can then review after a period of time. One way my project could potentially improve the user’s ability to self-regulate is by trying to motivate them through motivational quotes which according to the Qualitative Study of the Psychological Effects of Motivational Quotes (13), motivational quotes have a positive effect on individuals with the limitation being potential overexposure to motivational quotes leading to reduced motivation. From the study we can infer that sparingly using motivational quotes could help individuals become motivated and stay motivated throughout their time studying which is important as discussed in the comparative analysis of learning, retention, and study strategies article (14), which concludes that digital learning is much better with the caveat being reported motivation to keep studying being significantly lower.
