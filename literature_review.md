# Literature Review

I will store details of how I searched for papers for my literature review. This will include my seach terms, proccess of choosing papers for the review and all of the links for refferences. All papers were accessed on the 1st of July

## Search Terms 
I will be using two different search engines for finding literature. I will use the university library search and Google Scholar. 

### University Library 
I have used terms `digital note taking` to search for papers in the university search engine.
using this search query searched for papers that contained all three terms, the first 100 results contained fairly accurate search results.
I read titles and saved papers that seemed relevant. Here is a list of all papers that I found.

### Google Scholar
I have used the following search queries in Google Scholar to find papers. 
- `Note taking effectiveness`
- `Memorisation` AND `study techniques`
- `Effectiveness of learning methodologies`
- `Importance of note-taking`
- `Efficient spaced repetition`
- `Digital note-taking app comparison`
- `Repetition based studies` OR `learning app effectiveness`

### Tools

I need to do some research for the tools I will be using to build the artefact.

#### Programming language
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html#email-examples
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html

Python will be used to create the web application because of it's extensive documentation, resources and simplicity. It can also be used to interact with a database and SMTP server.
#### Frameworks
- https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/
- https://htmx.org/

Flask is a WSGI web application framework, it makes it easy to implement common web patterns. It doesn't have an ORM and has great documentation.
HTMX is a javascript library that improves standard html5 so it's possible to build modern user interfaces without the use of React.

#### Database
- https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html

Sqlite3 will be the database engine because there are packages in python and flask to interact with it. There is plenty of documentation and examples of how to interact with it. It also supports a search feature that I can use to implement a search bar.
#### Source Control
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
- https://docs.github.com/en

Git is practically industry standard source management because of the price (it's free) and it's ecosystem (GitHub and GitLab). It integrateds with GitHub very well to offer secure code backups. 
#### SMTP server
- https://mailinabox.email/
- https://mailinabox.email/guide.html#video

Mail-in-a-box seems to be the simplest SMTP server that I could find for self hosting.
