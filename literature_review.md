# Literature Review document

I will store details of how I searched for papers for my literature review. This will include my seach terms, proccess of choosing papers for the review and all of the links for refferences. All papers were accessed on the 1st of July

## Search Terms 
I will be using two different search engines for finding literature. I will use the university library search and Google Scholar. 

### University Library 
I have used terms `digital note taking` to search for papers in the university search engine.
using this search query searched for papers that contained all three terms, the first 100 results contained fairly accurate search results.
I read titles and saved papers that seemed relevant. Here is a list of all papers that I found.

### Google Scholar
I have used the following search queries in Google Scholar to find papers. 
- `Note taking effectiveness`
- `Memorisation` AND `study techniques`
- `Effectiveness of learning methodologies`
- `Importance of note-taking`
- `Efficient spaced repetition`
- `Digital note-taking app comparison`
- `Repetition based studies` OR `learning app effectiveness`

### Tools

I need to do some research for the tools I will be using to build the artefact.

#### Programming language
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html#email-examples
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html

Python will be used to create the web application because of it's extensive documentation, resources and simplicity. It can also be used to interact with a database and SMTP server.
#### Frameworks
- https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/
- https://htmx.org/

Flask is a WSGI web application framework, it makes it easy to implement common web patterns. It doesn't have an ORM and has great documentation.
HTMX is a javascript library that improves standard html5 so it's possible to build modern user interfaces without the use of React.

#### Database
- https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html

Sqlite3 will be the database engine because there are packages in python and flask to interact with it. There is plenty of documentation and examples of how to interact with it. It also supports a search feature that I can use to implement a search bar.
#### Source Control
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
- https://docs.github.com/en

Git is practically industry standard source management because of the price (it's free) and it's ecosystem (GitHub and GitLab). It integrateds with GitHub very well to offer secure code backups. 
#### SMTP server
- https://mailinabox.email/
- https://mailinabox.email/guide.html#video

Mail-in-a-box seems to be the simplest SMTP server that I could find for self hosting.

## Literature Review
I will be writting the literature review and add temporary citations. Later I will add this content to the final report

### Note Taking 
Technological advancements made in recent decades have improved access to information and technology which has also advanced note taking. The digitization of note taking in recent years has sparked research in the effectiveness of digital note taking with one paper suggesting that digital notes taken on a laptop (1) are more effective than long-hand notes for similar-text related learning and image-related learning whereas long-hand notes are more effective for text-related learning however, the paper concludes that the effectiveness of either note-taking method largely depends on the contents as well as whether the notes are reviewed suggesting that spaced repetition should be used. A separate thesis claims that note-taking effectiveness also depends on whether the notes are self-generated or guided notes (2) suggesting that while guided notes alleviate the cognitive load on individuals, they could be less effective than self-generated notes because the individual would not be able to express as much freedom in their note-taking, potentially limiting their ability to create personal and meaningful notes developing relations between notes and learning material. Interestingly, the thesis claims that neither note-taking method outperformed their control condition on a multiple-choice quiz suggesting that there are many variables that need to be evaluated when considering the effectiveness of notes which are the quantity, quality, mode of note taking and review of notes (2). These studies imply that a balance of high quality and quantity of notes is required in either mode of note taking whether digital or long-hand for improved results. 

The thesis (2) also discusses student preferences between guided notes and long-hand written notes where it claims that students generally prefer guided notes and since they found that neither mode of note-taking is more effective than the other but the effectiveness solely depends on the quality, quantity and repetitive review of notes,  you could assume that there is no reason to create notes yourself however, a report on strategic note taking for students (3) disagrees and claims that strategic note-taking (self-generated note-taking) is an important skill involving the processing of information and writing and listening skills, suggesting that students with better note-taking skills achieve better grades. It argues that students who copy information for notes instead of actively processing it themselves are negatively affecting their studies because they do not fully understand the material therefore the notes are not beneficial to them. The report suggests that students should aim to improve their note quality by actively processing the learning material as it is the most beneficial while recognizing that some students find it difficult to recognize and organize content based on relevance, with that in mind it discusses an experiment involving middle school students (3) who use strategic note-taking and based on the results draws a conclusion that active self-generated notes are generally higher in quality therefore lead to improved understanding of the material which in turn leads to better grades. The report discussed thoroughly and reasonably explained why active notetaking is vital to students. However, it does not discuss how to improve note-taking skills or how often notes should be revised. 
The reviewed literature about note-taking provides insights about how valuable they can be when an individual actively processes information and creates notes of the information and periodically reviews the notes. However, based on the data of a survey conducted in 2019 (4), approximately half of students in university do not take notes as the lecture and lab study materials are available to the students online removing the need for students to attend live lectures or labs. As technology further advances and more study materials are digitized students do not feel the need or the pressure to take notes on material they can view anytime they need or use advanced tools to generate notes on the material, but these approaches do not help learn and understand the material, they simply rephrase the material (3). For my project, users would have a list of suggestions that they could incorporate to improve the quality of their notes, but it is important to consider the difference between guidelines and suggestions as the purpose of the application is to allow users to generate their own notes.
