# Project Plan

I need to submit 4 files :
- unzipped professionalism report
- unzipped project report
- zipped meeting logbook forms
- zipped artefact

I will not be submitting the meeting logbook forms as I have not met my supervisor for a while and I am not planning to me him in the next 3 weeks. in it's place, my timesheets and this entire git repository will be uploaded to show evidence of time management.

## project report

the final project report will consist of the following chapters. chapters 3 - 6 will most likely generate additional files to be submitted as evidence, for example ERD diagrams, wireframes, testing plan, pseudocode and code. Some of the evidence will be included in the apendix of the final report and all additional evidence will be submitted with the zipped artefact alongside some documentation.

```
1. introduction
1.1 project motivation
1.2 introduction to research topic
1.3 aims and objectives of the project
1.4 scope and limitations
2. literature review
3. requirement analysis
4. system design
5. implementation
6. testing
7. evaluation
```

## zipped artefact

this will be a zip of this repository. it will include the code and documentation.

## timeline

I need to submit something by 14:00 on the 10th of July.

Today, I will finish the plan and start working on the first chapter of the final report.

I will start researching for the literature review tomorrow (27th of june) and will try to finish both the literature review, requirement analysis and system design by 30th of june.

the first 5 days of July will be reversed for me to implement and test the artefact. 6-7th July will be writing up 5th and 6th chapters of the final report, testing the artefact, gathering feedback from real users (if possible) and documenting outcomes.

8-9th of July will be writing the professionalism report and writing the evaluation chapter of the final report.

the last day will be reserved for final checks
