# draft

I will write out a draft version of different written parts of the project in this document. 

## project motivation

during my studies at university I had a difficult time implementing good revision practices and studying for exams. This has directly influenced my grades and the skills I learned in university. I want to build a tool to help me and other students revise for exams and learn their study material through spaced repetition / review - based learning. 


## artefact stack and other tools for the project

I want to use Git and Github for time management. I will keep a folder of timesheets for each day I work and write down timed entries of work I do. This will help me see where I am spending my time and what exactly I been doing each day. I want to use Typst for writing the final report because the source file can be tracked in Git and it can be exported to PDF. Using this approach will also make my project more transparent for marking as there is evidence of time management and work completed through out the next few weeks.

## project plan

today is the 24th of June. I have 17 days left till I have to submit something. (10th of July) I already have some idea of what I want to do for my project.

I will spend June 25th writing out aims, objectives, scope of the project and limitations. I will also start the literature review. 

Once the literature review is completed, I will be able to start analysis requirements for my artefact and do a system design.

I want to be able to start building the artefact by early next week to have enough time to test it and find a few real users to test the artefact.

I will most likely be writing the final report alongside each section I complete of the list below. I will also add new subsections as I go along and I will most likely make a dedicated markdown file for the plan.
