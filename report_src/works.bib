    abstract = { Concern that students in the United States are less proficient in mathematics, science, and reading than their peers in other countries has led some to question whether American students spend enough time in school. Instead of debating the amount of time that should be spent in school (and on schoolwork), this article addresses how the available instructional time might be optimally utilized via the scheduling of review or practice. Hundreds of studies in cognitive and educational psychology have demonstrated that spacing out repeated encounters with the material over time produces superior long-term learning, compared with repetitions that are massed together. Also, incorporating tests into spaced practice amplifies the benefits. Spaced review or practice enhances diverse forms of learning, including memory, problem solving, and generalization to new situations. Spaced practice is a feasible and cost-effective way to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning, and has tremendous potential to improve educational outcomes. The article also discusses barriers to adopting spaced practice, recent developments, and their possible implications. }

abstract = {Abstract While task repetition is effective for improving oral fluency, some teachers are reluctant to use it in their classrooms due to the alleged negative perceptions of learners toward repetitive practice. To address this concern, the participants in the current study completed a posttask questionnaire probing their perceptions toward task repetition practice, focusing on metacognitive judgment (i.e., the number of task repetitions considered effective) and emotional engagement (i.e., enjoyment and concentration). Prior to taking the survey, 64 second language learners individually performed the same picture-description task six times under one of the three repetition schedules (massed, short-spaced, and long-spaced condition). Their posttask questionnaire results indicated that task repetition was perceived as an effective and engaging activity (about four to five performances were deemed to be most optimal). Relative to massed task repetition, short- and long-spaced schedules led to higher perceived effectiveness and emotional engagement. Moreover, while the short-spaced group made accurate metacognitive judgment of their fluency gains, learners in the massed practice condition overestimated their fluency gains, possibly due to enjoyment and illusion of high competence. These findings indicate that spacing between task repetitions can influence learners’ engagement in the task, which can impact their fluency development.},

The historical reliance on textbook reading is being increasingly replaced by trainees in favor of using non-traditional platforms such as podcasts, videos, and app-based learning. Neuroscience research on human learning has demonstrated superior long-term retention when the synergistic principles of spaced repetition and active recall are employed. Spaced repetition entails the repeated exposure to learned material over successive iterations, whereas active recall involves the intentional reconstructive process of retrieving previously learned material, often through prompting (e.g., answering open-ended questions without multiple choice answers), rather than passively reviewing previously learned information (e.g., re-reading a textbook chapter). These concepts have revolutionized medical student education, with use of open-source spaced repetition platforms, such as Anki, and question banks becoming ubiquitous. Paralleling educational platforms within otolaryngology are emerging. Headmirror's OtoRecall app provides a free, peer-reviewed, open-access option for otolaryngology trainees to harness the power of these learning principles.}

abstract = {Understanding human memory has been a long-standing problem in various scientific disciplines. Early works focused on characterizing human memory using small-scale controlled experiments and these empirical studies later motivated the design of spaced repetition algorithms for efficient memorization. However, current spaced repetition algorithms are rule-based heuristics with hard-coded parameters, which do not leverage the automated fine-grained monitoring and greater degree of control offered by modern online learning platforms. In this work, we develop a computational framework to derive optimal spaced repetition algorithms, specially designed to adapt to the learners’ performance. A large-scale natural experiment using data from a popular language-learning online platform provides empirical evidence that the spaced repetition algorithms derived using our framework are significantly superior to alternatives. Spaced repetition is a technique for efficient memorization which uses repeated review of content following a schedule determined by a spaced repetition algorithm to improve long-term retention. However, current spaced repetition algorithms are simple rule-based heuristics with a few hard-coded parameters. Here, we introduce a flexible representation of spaced repetition using the framework of marked temporal point processes and then address the design of spaced repetition algorithms with provable guarantees as an optimal control problem for stochastic differential equations with jumps. For two well-known human memory models, we show that, if the learner aims to maximize recall probability of the content to be learned subject to a cost on the reviewing frequency, the optimal reviewing schedule is given by the recall probability itself. As a result, we can then develop a simple, scalable online spaced repetition algorithm, MEMORIZE, to determine the optimal reviewing times. We perform a large-scale natural experiment using data from Duolingo, a popular language-learning online platform, and show that learners who follow a reviewing schedule determined by our algorithm memorize more effectively than learners who follow alternative schedules determined by several heuristics.}}

abstract="Background: Note-taking is a method that has long been used to optimize studying. Recent innovations have seen the introduction of digital note-taking using software apps. Although the current state of digital note-taking has been verified mainly among students, the use and efficacy of digital note-taking by physicians in actual clinical practice remain unknown. Therefore, we sought to understand the characteristics of note-taking residents using a note-taking app and determine whether there is a difference in basic medical knowledge compared to that of nondigital note-taking residents. Objective: This study investigated the use of a digital note-taking app by Japanese resident physicians. Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in resident physicians during the General Medicine In-Training Examination (GM-ITE), a clinical competency examination for resident physicians. The GM-ITE is a multiple-choice test with a maximum score of 80 points. Using a structured questionnaire, we collected data on the sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, postgraduate year [PGY], or others), clinical training, GM-ITE scores, and the use of an app for note-taking to record case experience. The GM-ITE evaluated the scores by dividing them into 4 groups (groups 1‐4), in order from the lowest to the highest. We conducted a multivariate analysis of sociodemographic, clinical training, and GM-ITE score variables to determine the independent predictors of the use of a digital note-taking app. Results: This study included 3833 participants; 1242 (32.4{\%}) were female, 1988 (51.8{\%}) were PGY 1 residents, 2628 (68.6{\%}) were training in a rural area, 3236 (84.4{\%}) were in community-based hospitals, and 1750 (45.3{\%}) were app users. The app users were more likely to be in their PGY 2, to work in a community-based hospital, to have general internal medicine rotation experience, to use online medical resources more frequently, and to have more time for self-study. The results showed that the app users group had a higher GM-ITE score than the nonapp users group (adjusted odds ratio 0.74, 95{\%} CI 0.25 to 1.22; P=.003). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate note-taking by physicians in Japan using apps. The app users group had a higher GM-ITE score than the nonapp users, suggesting that they may have higher clinical skills. In the future, we would like to conduct more in-depth research on the facts of note-taking using apps, based on our results. ",

    abstract = { Online learning is a relatively new but emerging approach in Philippine education. The approach's rise in popularity warrants an emphasis on self-regulated learning (SRL). Hence, the current study aimed to propose and assess an intervention using a digital note-taking application as an SRL tool for Business Math. Data collection included the administration of a pre-test and a post-test and weekly ratings of digital notebook usage. Two-way ANCOVA results suggest that skillful self-regulators consistently achieved more than naïve self-regulators. Hierarchal regression analysis results imply that learners with better digital notebooks are likelier to achieve more in the course. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SRL intervention used in the study. Furthermore, repeated measures of ANOVA results suggest that different groups of learners use their SRL tools differently. Despite the effect of SRL tools on achievement, higher achievers are not certainly better self-regulators than lower achievers. }

               Externally, motivational quotes often encapsulate universal
               truths or wisdom, offering perspective and guidance from varied
               sources and figures. This paper explores the effectiveness of
               motivational quotes in medical and educational contexts, with a
               focus on their impact on individuals' behavior. While numerous
               studies have reported a generally positive attitude toward the
               use of motivational quotes, specific concerns have emerged. This
               paper has observed that motivational quotes, delivered through
               various media, have successfully motivated individuals to take
               positive actions, such as adhering to medication regimens and
