# Implementation diary

I will note down issues I encountered during the development of my artefact.

## Database

Sqlite3 doesn't support the use of datetime function as a column default value. it's at all not a problem for my use case but I wasted 20 minutes.

Logging my time has been a nuisance. I have wasted a significant amount of time on logging time and it has created some motivational struggles. I will stop logging time and commit more often.

maybe have a daily log where I spend 5-15 reflecting on the day's work.
